### Budget management

Budget management is based on the sub-task time tracking, the user timetable and the user hourly rate.

This section is available from project settings page: **Project > Budget**. There is also a shortcut from the drop-down menu on the board.

#### Budget Lines

Budget lines are used to define a budget for the project.
This budget can be adjusted by adding a new entry with an effective date.

#### Cost Breakdown

Based on the subtask time tracking table and user information you can see the cost of each subtask.

The time spent is rounded to the nearest quarter.

#### Budget Chart

Finally, by combining all information we can generate a graph:

- Expenses represent user costs
- Budget lines are the provisioned budget
- Remaining is the budget left at the given time

### Hourly Rate

Each user can have a pre-defined hourly rate.
This feature is used for budget calculation.

To define a new price, go to **User profile > Hourly rates**.

Each hourly rate can have an effective date and different currencies.
